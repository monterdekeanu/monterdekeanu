# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Keanu Monterde

## ðŸ‘€ About Me
Hello! I'm Keanu Monterde, a passionate developer with a keen interest in building innovative web and mobile applications. With a strong background in C#, I am dedicated to creating solutions that are both efficient and user-friendly.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Currently Learning
I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies. Currently, I am focusing on:
- **.NET MAUI:** Developing cross-platform applications with a single codebase.
- **Blazor:** Building interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.
- **ASP.NET Core:** Creating robust and scalable web applications and APIs.

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience
I am currently a Project Manager at Edmond Dantes Consulting INC., where I lead teams in developing Java applications with a specialization in microservices architecture. My role involves:
- Overseeing project development from inception to completion.
- Ensuring the delivery of high-quality software solutions.
- Collaborating with clients to understand their requirements and provide tailored solutions.

## ðŸ”­ Future Goals
While I have extensive experience in Java, I am increasingly fascinated by the capabilities of C#. My goal is to dive deeper into the C# ecosystem, exploring its potential and leveraging it to create more sophisticated and efficient applications. I am excited about the journey ahead and the new projects I will embark on using C#.
